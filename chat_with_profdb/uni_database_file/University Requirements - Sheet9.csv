https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/programme-specific-requirements","Digital technology has provided a multimedia, multi-layered set of opportunities for Graphic Design, Illustration and Photography. Students now incorporate the traditional skills of drawing, printing, photography and other graphic processes with video, sound, animation and other aspects of moving image and multimedia. Students are no longer defined by their specialism but through their creative interpretations and articulation of the brief.

In order for a student to develop a vision of the future, they need an understanding of the past.

Learning is supported by a weekly series of professional practice lectures, in which some of the most respected designers in Europe visit the School and meet our students."
