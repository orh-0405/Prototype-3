4,SUTD (Singapore University of Technology and Design),"Subject Requirements (H1/H2/H3/GP/KI/PW)
The University accepts applications from both Science and Arts stream students.

â€‹You should possess good passes in at least three H2 content-based subjects, one H1 content-based subject, Project Work and attempted General Paper (GP) or Knowledge & Inquiry (KI). 
Other acceptable subject combinations include: four H2 content-based subjects, Project Work and GP; or three H2 content-based subjects, Project Work and KI.

While it is recommended that you have taken Mathematics and a Science subject, i.e. Physics or Chemistry, at H2, we do consider your results in Mathematics and the Science subjects taken at H1, O-level or equivalent as well.

Mother Tongue Language (MTL)
All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are required to fulfil the MTL requirement for admission into full-time publicly-funded undergraduate programmes in the universities.
 
The MTL requirement may be fulfilled through the following:
a. a D7 grade for Higher MTL at Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level (the iGCSE MTL First Language examination does not fulfil the requirement); or
b. a pass in H2 MTL Language and Literature or H1 General Studies in Chinese at Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level;

Those who have not fulfilled the MTL requirement may still apply for admission with no prejudice to their application. However, if accepted, they will be required to fulfil the MTL requirement during their course of study. 

Computation of University Score
When computing the University Score, we will take into consideration the following: The best three H2 and one H1 content-based subjects, of which one must be a contrasting subject GP or KI (taken in the same sitting as the H2 subjects)/Project Work (PW)",
